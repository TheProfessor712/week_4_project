For you, the reader, is laid before you a dispassionate list of the variable
names which I mustered together with the same minimal enthusiasm as one would
during languors copulation with a fading romantic flame one intends to soon
abandon. I will enthusiastically take the loss on this part of the project.
Enjoy.

features<-read.table("features.txt")
features[,2]
